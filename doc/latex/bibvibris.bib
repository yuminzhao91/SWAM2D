  Abstract                 = {This work aims at developing a numerical tool to model 3D seismic waves propagation in complex geological media where site effects prevail. The spectral element method (SEM) is particularly well adapted to the site effects modeling problematic : accurate surface waves evaluation, ability to handle complex geometries (free surface topography, interfaces) and the possibility of adapting the wavelengths resolution in heterogeneous media conditions with unstructured meshes. Numerical extensions of the SEM linked with the basin response were developed : filtering Perfectly Matched Layers and efficient introduction of an incident wave field. This 3D code was implemented with an object orientation to facilitate its parallelization, ensure a greater modularity and handle unstructured meshes. Currently, the principal limitation of the SEM comes, however, from the lack of flexibility of hexahedral meshes, despite the use of unstructured meshes whose generation remains a complex task. This work emphasizes the difficulties linked with the handling of such structures and describes the complete process for the modeling of the seismic response in complex geological media, from the physical and numerical model elaboration through to the results analysis. We present here 3D simulations of the seismic response in the Caracas area (Venezuela), including the 3D geometry of the basin and the Ávila barrier which borders the city. Data were supplied by the FUNVISIS agency (ECOS-Nord project). The importance of the effects linked with these two types of structures is assessed with different scenarios of plane wave excitation. These 3D geometrical effects reveal complex amplification phenomena associated with the reflection and the focalisation of waves propagating in all directions, and with the generation of surface waves at the edge and in narrowing areas of the basin. A comparison with 2D simulations shows the interest of 3D modeling : clear differences in terms of residency time and energy and amplification level were exhibited.}

  Abstract                 = {Perfectly matched layers (PMLs) provide an exponential decay, independent of the frequency, of any propagating field along an assigned direction without producing spurious reflections at the interface with the elastic volume. For this reason PMLs have been applied as absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) and their efficiency in attenuating outgoing wave fields on the outskirts of numerical grids is more and more recognized. However, PMLs are designed for first-order differential equations and a natural extension to second-order Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) involves either additional variables in the time evolution scheme or convolutional operations. Both techniques are computationally expensive when implemented in a spectral element (SE) code and other ABCs (e.g. paraxial or standard sponge methods) still remain more attractive than PMLs. Here, an efficient second-order implementation of PMLs for SE is developed from interpreting the Newmark scheme as a time-staggered velocity–stress algorithm. The discrete equivalence with the standard scheme is based on an L 2 approximation of the stress field, with the same polynomial order as the velocity. In this case, PMLs can be introduced as for first-order equations preserving the natural second-order time stepping. Subsequently, a non-classical frequency-dependent perfectly matched layer is introduced by moving the pole of the stretching along the imaginary axis. In this case, the absorption depends on the frequency and the layer switches from a transparent behaviour at low frequencies to a uniform absorption as the frequency goes to infinity. It turns out to be more efficient than classical PMLs in the absorption of the incident waves, as the grazing incidence approaches, at the cost of a memory variable for any split component. Finally, an extension of PMLs to general curvilinear coordinates is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {A spectral element method for the approximate solution of linear elastodynamic equations, set in a weak form, is shown to provide an e cient tool for simulating elastic wave propagation in realistic geological structures in two- and three-dimensional geometries. The computational domain is discretized into quadrangles, or hexahedra, deÿned with respect to a reference unit domain by an invertible local mapping. Inside each reference element, the numerical integration is based on the tensor-product of a Gauss –Lobatto –Legendre 1-D quadrature and the solution is expanded onto a discrete polynomial basis using Lagrange interpolants. As a result, the mass matrix is always diagonal, which drastically reduces the computational cost and allows an e cient parallel implementation. Absorbing boundary conditions are introduced in variational form to simulate unbounded physical domains. The time discretization is based on an energy-momentum conserving scheme that can be put into a classical explicit-implicit predictor=multicorrector format. Long term energy conservation and stability properties are illustrated as well as the e ciency of the absorbing conditions. The accuracy of the method is shown by comparing the spectral element results to numerical solutions of some classical two-dimensional problems obtained by other methods. The potentiality of the method is then illustrated by studying a simple three-dimensional model. Very accurate modelling of Rayleigh wave propagation and surface di raction is obtained at a low computational cost. The method is shown to provide an e cient tool to study the di raction of elastic waves and the large ampliÿcation of ground motion caused by three-dimensional surface topographies.},

The use of cross-correlations, that contain information on the location of noise sources, clean the dispersion diagram that would be obtain from passive MASW alone, by removing artifacts due to the ambiguity between source location and wave velocity in the beamforming process. The prposed method is tested with synthetic records computed for various configurations of array geometry and noise distribution. It is then applied on passive recordings performed along a sea dike, and surface-wave velocities that favorably compare with the ones obtained with hammer shots are retrieved from ambient vibrations generated by sea waves, in a larger frequency band.},
